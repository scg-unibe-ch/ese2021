## General information

* [ESE course page](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese)
* Use <a href="https://piazza.com/unibe.ch/fall2020/ese2020/home">Piazza</a> to ask questions and get answers.

The goal of project in the course "Introduction to Software Engineering (ESE)" is to offer a concrete and practical contact with the phases, techniques, and artefacts of an iterative and incremental software development process.

The lecture builds upon knowledge acquired in P1 and P2:

* P1 was about programming: what is a programming language and what is a program
* [P2](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/p2) was about development: how can we design a solution which follows the state of the art and what are the best programming practices?
* [ESE](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) is about software engineering: how can we work in a team to deliver products which meet customer’s expectations

During the project, a concrete software is created through teamwork and it needs to be delivered as a product at the end of the semester — and this is really fun and cool :)

The final grade will be composed from 60% exam + 40% project.

[Register for the course through the form](TBD) and register on [Ilias](TBD) **until Sunday night, TBD.09.2021**.

***Please note that most of the exercise related activities will be helpd online due to COVID-19.***


# Project 

TBD 

# Project organization

Students/participants will be divided into small groups (each group will have roughly 4-5 students). Each group will build the software independently. One student from each group will act as a Product Owner (PO), who will co-ordinate the communication with assitant. PO will then proactively discuss the reqirements with his/her fellow team members.

The total duration for the project is 12 weeks. First 4 weeks will be given to learn technologies and clear the underlying concepts, **also to start developing**. The project will be developed as a series of *features*.
Exercise hours mostly consist of meetings of assistants with their corresponding teams. However, there will be few weeks, where we will present few important topics.
At the end, the best project will receive a surprise prize!
