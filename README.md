## General information

* [ESE course page](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese)
* Use <a href="https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_frm_2183220.html">Ilias</a> to ask questions and get answers.

The goal of project in the course "Introduction to Software Engineering (ESE)" is to offer a concrete and practical contact with the phases, techniques, and artefacts of an iterative and incremental software development process.

The lecture builds upon knowledge acquired in P1 and P2:

* P1 was about programming: what is a programming language and what is a program
* [P2](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/p2) was about development: how can we design a solution which follows the state of the art and what are the best programming practices?
* [ESE](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) is about software engineering: how can we work in a team to deliver products which meet customer’s expectations

During the project, a concrete software is created through teamwork and it needs to be delivered as a product at the end of the semester — and this is really fun and cool :)

The final grade will be composed from 60% exam + 40% project.

[Register for the course through the form](https://forms.gle/WAt5aeeELszQ4hbq6) and register on [Ilias](https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_frm_2183220.html) **until Sunday night, 19.09.2021**.

***Please note that as per the latest guidelines from the university, exercise hours can be held in person as long as students are vaccinated, recovered, or have recently been tested and if they do not feel ill. If students do not meet these requirements, the university strongly encourages them to follow the other (online) alternatives provided by the lecturer. As ESE exercise hours mainly consist of meetings with team members and respective assistants, the following guidelines must be kept in mind: masks do not have to be worn in the workplace if everyone present has a certificate and maintains a distance of 1.50 meters. Employees who do not have a valid certificate must wear a mask in the workplace. Meetings can be conducted in person if all participants have a Covid certificate and maintain a distance of 1.50 meters. Discussions, meetings, etc. cannot be attended in person without a valid certificate. Students can discuss their preferences with their respective assistants***


# Project 

TBD 

# Project organization

Students/participants will be divided into small teams (each team will have roughly 4-5 students). Each team will build the application independently. One student from each team will act as a Product Owner (PO), who will mainly co-ordinate the communication with assitant. Nevertheless, all team members are encouraged to participate in discussions or to clarify requirements or ask doubts.

The total duration for the project is 12 weeks. First 4 weeks will be given to learn technologies and clear the underlying concepts, **also to start developing**. The project will be developed as a series of *features*.
Exercise hours mostly consist of meetings of assistants with their corresponding teams. However, there will be few weeks, where we will present few important topics.
At the end, the best project will receive a surprise prize!
