# ESE 2021
This repository contains important material (presentations, project description, schedule) to get started with the project.

## General information

* [ESE course page](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese)
* Use <a href="https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_frm_2183220.html">Ilias</a> to ask questions and get answers.

The goal of project in the course "Introduction to Software Engineering (ESE)" is to offer a concrete and practical contact with the phases, techniques, and artefacts of an iterative and incremental software development process.

The lecture builds upon knowledge acquired in P1 and P2:

* P1 was about programming: what is a programming language and what is a program
* [P2](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/p2) was about development: how can we design a solution which follows the state of the art and what are the best programming practices?
* [ESE](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) is about software engineering: how can we work in a team to deliver products which meet customer’s expectations

During the project, a concrete software is created through teamwork and it needs to be delivered as a product at the end of the semester — and this is really fun and cool :)

The final grade will be composed from 60% exam + 40% project.

[Register for the course through the form](https://forms.gle/WAt5aeeELszQ4hbq6) and register on [Ilias](https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_frm_2183220.html) **until Sunday night, 26.09.2021**.

***Please note that as per the latest guidelines from the university, lectures and exercises can be held in person. However, considering the fact that every student might have different situation and preference for their physical presence, we have decided to do ESE exercises online. We will discuss the details in the first exercise hour.***


# Project 

This year, students in small teams will build a small web application using Angular and Express. 
In this application, users (fans of a specific topic, e.g., Harry Potter fans, Manchester United fans) can create posts. 
Basically, you will build a fan community platform to post related content, such as memes, photos, and buy fan merchandise in an online store.
We will divide students into teams of 5-6, and each team can pick up a common interest for which they want to build such a platform. 
We will provide the necessary requirements and guide students through the entire process of development and project management.   

# Project organization

Students/participants will be divided into small teams (each team will have roughly 4-5 students). Each team will build the application independently. One student from each team will act as a Product Owner (PO), who will mainly co-ordinate the communication with assitant. Nevertheless, all team members are encouraged to participate in discussions or to clarify requirements or ask doubts.

The total duration for the project is 12 weeks. First 4 weeks will be given to learn technologies and clear the underlying concepts, **also to start developing**. The project will be developed as a series of *features*.
Exercise hours mostly consist of meetings of assistants with their corresponding teams. However, there will be few weeks, where we will present few important topics.
At the end, the best project will receive a surprise prize!
